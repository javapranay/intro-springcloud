High Availability Eureka Server
--------------------------------
Need to create two profiles for each Eureka server
For example, lets say
1. Eureka Instance One - eurekainstance1
2. Eureka Instance Two - eurekainstance2

Give information about eurekainstance1 to eurekainstance2 and vice versa.

We have to put host entries for these eureka instance names.
